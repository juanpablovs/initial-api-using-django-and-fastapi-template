# initial-api-using-django-and-fastapi-template

Hi,

Iâ€™ve noticed that some people are struggling to build an API using Django and FastApi
Django: https://www.djangoproject.com/
FastApi: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/

Since so many people seem to be having problems following the FastApi documentation I wrote this simple script that helps with the initial setup of the FastApi documentation.

This is the standard initial implementation; it uses SQL and other basic features so you can focus on how it is built.

Once you understand the structure you can improve the code and replace the SQL with classes and implement other more advanced features.

You will see that it becomes easier after understanding this initial setup.

I have included the requirements.txt file so you can replicate the environment. Just in case that at the time you are reading this there are new versions of either Django or FastApi.

Hope that you find it useful and that it helps!
